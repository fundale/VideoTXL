AudioSource Config Cards

Place prefab in world and set the audio source field.  You can carry the card
around and change several audio source values at runtime.

The card may not work as expected for all options for all audio sources (e.g.
those attached to a unity video player or AV Pro player).  These are likely
limitations of those players and/or vrchat.
